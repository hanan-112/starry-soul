                  contrast. By placing the purple flowers against a yellow

              “What would life be if we had no courage to attempt anything?
              Success is sometimes the outcome of a whole string of failures,
              and I tell you frankly that I often feel weak. But I press on
              nonetheless, even when I am tired and disheartened. The road is

              colored than the day. When I look at the stars, I imagine that
              perhaps we take death to go to a star, and we are there alive.
              Why, I ask myself, shouldn't the shining dots of the sky be as
              accessible as the black dots on the map of France? Just as we take
              a train to go to Tarascon or Rouen, we take death to go to a

            <p class="bio">
              Born in 1853 in the Netherlands, Vincent van Gogh created more
              than 2,000 artworks in just over a decade — a life driven by
              passion, color, poverty, and perseverance. Throughout his troubled
              journey, Van Gogh wrote more than 900 letters, many of them to his
              beloved brother Theo, in which he revealed his fears,
              philosophies, and unwavering love for art. These letters remain a
              window into his brilliant and aching mind. Despite his mental
              health struggles and a world that largely ignored his genius, he
              painted with relentless energy — capturing light, fields, people,
              and sky with a raw intensity. On 29 July 1890, after years of
              emotional suffering and isolation, Van Gogh died at the age of 37.
              Though he passed with little recognition, today his name echoes
              through the halls of every great museum, and his work continues to
              touch hearts across generations.
